# FreeNutrition

FreeNutrition will serve as a free and open-source personal nutrition tracking aid. Our goal is to enable users to track dietary
components, such as macronutrients and vitamins, over time. FreeNutrition is powered by pyqt and is available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems.
